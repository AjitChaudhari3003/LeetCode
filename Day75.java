// 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target
// You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.
// Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.
// Example 1:

// Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
// Output: "c"
// Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.

// CODE

class Solution {
    public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
        int n=letters.length;
        char c =letters[0];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if( letters[i] > target){
              c=letters[i];
                return  c;
            }
        }
        return c;
    }
}
